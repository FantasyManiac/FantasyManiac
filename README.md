## About Me
👋 Hello! I’m   ✨  ***@FantasyManiac***  ✨

I love programming and every subject about it. be it **Web developement (front-end && back-end)**, **AI**, **Game developement**, etc.

Designing is also one of my passions! 🌺

Normally people learn skills in order to live; but I live in order to learn and use skills. 😍
